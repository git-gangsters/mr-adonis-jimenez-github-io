# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

This project is a personal website. Only the most recent version is actively supported.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

I take all security reports seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it privately. **Please do not disclose the vulnerability publicly until it has been fixed.**

### Private Reporting
I prefer to receive reports via GitHub's **Private Vulnerability Reporting** feature.

1.  Go to the "Security" tab of this repository.
2.  Click "Report a vulnerability".
3.  Fill out the form with as much detail as possible, including steps to reproduce the issue.

### What to Expect
I will do my best to:
* Acknowledge the report within 48 hours.
* Provide a timeline for a fix.
* Notify you once the vulnerability has been patched.

Thank you for helping to keep my project secure!
